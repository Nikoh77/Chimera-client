This is the Chimèra project, basically an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game">"OMORPG"</a> (Open source Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game).<br>
We are creating something between a second life and a RPG, on a persistent virtual universe (Please see our <a href="https://github.com/Nikoh77/Chimera-client/wiki">wiki</a> for more info).<br>
Chimèra differs from all mmorpgs because anyone can join his server (his instance) to the Chimèra Federation as happens in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">"fediverse"</a>, about social networks like <a href="https://mastodon.social">Mastodon</a>.<br>
On our first istance we decided to use 2D/Pixel Art graphic style like Chrono Trigger, Star Ocean etc. but you could also decide to use all three dimensions in your instance.<br>
We also decided to use <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot 4 Game Engine.</a><br>
Initially the working group is made up of Italians but anyone can contribute, as long as you forgive me for the bad English I speak ;-)<br>
We need 2d graphics (or ai users like scenario, midjourney and so on) and Godot experts.<br>
